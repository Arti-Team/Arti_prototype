### 7️⃣ Reflection

Write 2–3 sentences about your personal takeaways or team experience this week.

> To address the issue where the art_curation_node runtime exceeded 2 minutes, the image candidate pool was significantly reduced from 150 to 80 images.
> While this change may decrease the diversity of user experiences, it has the advantage of greatly improving usability by ensuring a much faster and more stable runtime.
