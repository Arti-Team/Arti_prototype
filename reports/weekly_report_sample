### 1️⃣ Weekly Overview

Provide a short summary (3–5 sentences) of what you worked on this week. Focus on technical progress, learning outcomes, and any key milestones.

> Example: This week, I completed the integration of the emotion recognition model with the LangGraph dialogue system. I also debugged data loading issues in the DREAMER dataset and improved inference speed by optimizing the batch size. Next week, I plan to test the system’s response accuracy with real conversation data.

### 4️⃣ Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge                         | Root Cause                           | Solution / Next Step                                  |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Model instability during training | Small batch size and gradient spikes | Applied gradient clipping and learning rate scheduler |
| Dataset label imbalance           | Emotion classes unevenly distributed | Used SMOTE oversampling + class weighting             |
| API timeout issue                 | Inefficient caching structure        | Implemented Redis caching layer                       |

### 6️⃣ Collaboration & Requests

* Request UI team to test model latency in the frontend
* Need updated emotion icon set from design team
* Suggest a short sync-up on dataset alignment (Tue 8 PM)

---

### 7️⃣ Reflection

Write 2–3 sentences about your personal takeaways or team experience this week.

> Example: I realized that optimizing model performance isn’t just about training—it’s also about system design. Communication with the design team helped clarify user experience goals, which I’ll keep in mind during future iterations.

### ✅ Best Practices

* **Keep it concise:** Each section should fit in 1 screen view.
* **Use markdown for clarity:** Easier to track changes in GitHub or Notion.
* **Submit by:** Every Sunday night or Monday morning.
* **Highlight impact:** Focus not just on *what* you did, but *why it matters* for the project goal.
